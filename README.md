# ECSE 321 Project - Town Library System

A website and app providing multiple functionalities for a small town's library.

## Where are all the files and team information!?

This branch ***only contains the code for the Android app***.

The rest of the files can be found in the [default branch](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Fall2021/project-group-11) unfortunately named `feature/project-template` due to technical issues our team encountered during deliverable 1.
